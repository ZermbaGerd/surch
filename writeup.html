        This project was created as part of my final project for my History of Racism and Digital Technology (HIST394) class, 
        taken at Macalester College with Professor Walter Greason.

        It's generally a commentary on the prevalence of digital surveillance, the impacts of such surveillance, and resistance (both creative and destructive) to that surveillance.

    <p> If you're interested in some of the other work I've created for this class, you can see my mid-term review essay of Safiya Umoja Noble's
        Algorithms of Oppression <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zAmzDDLL1jvDDlWyPk6cFSoFNe_puBpZunXtsiOVBbo/edit?usp=sharing"> here</a>,
        and you can see my final essay, where I compared the arguments in that book with Ruha Benjamin's arguments in her book Race After Technology
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RpLMTntxhDU2ot_q22o6iLvOiYUe4WeqyR5bTJ9fUKI/edit?usp=sharing"> here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The central argument I wanted to discuss in my final project revolves around the various ways that social recommendation algorithms,
        like the TikTok For You Page (FYP), YouTube Recommended, and Netflix recommendations, operate. I found myself struck by the prevalence
        of subcultures on TikTok. Many users' FYP's create extraordinarily insulated communities, where a single joke or soundtrack
        appears in 20 - 40% of every TikTok they see, despite making up only a miniscule portion of the overall content on the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
        These communities are prime to become echo chambers, which are not only capable of fomenting extremism and violence, but are also harmful
        for the ways that they limit people's imaginations. When there are massive, massive portions of social activity happening completely
        out of your view, it becomes very difficult to imagine possible futures that serve the participants in those conversations. This imagination
        is vitally important for our future, because we can only create a world that functions differently to our own when we can imagine that world.
        I was particularly inspired by the fields of futurism and Afrofuturism.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this project, I wanted to bring attention to these unexplored horizons by reversing the typical strategy of recommendation algorithms. 
        Instead of finding the content that the user wouldn't like, and then hiding that content from them, I wanted to show them that content, 
        but explicitly censor portions of it, depending on how "relevant" the algorithm considered the content. I was inspired by the SCP online fiction community 
        (particularly the series of <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub">There is No Anti-Memetics Division</a> stories), where censorship 
        is used as a tool to tell more compelling stories, and place the reader within the universe. In this way, censorship brings attention to the censored content,
        instead of hiding it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to some time constraints, as well as some slightly lofty goals, I wasn't able to execute on every part of this plan. 
        Despite that, I'm still pretty happy with what I've produced. Most of the censorship visuals were packaged into my final 
        photographic essay. The website currently just shows randomly selected images, not actually implementing a recommendation 
        algorithm, but I've explored the implementation of an algorithm enough that I have some other resources available.
    </p>

    <br></br>

    <p>
        With that in mind, let's look at some of the most common recommendation algorithms and see what we can learn.
        These algorithms generally break down into two types: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. I'll focus
        more on collaborative filtering, because that's where the implementation for this project would have gone, and is also
        the strategy that most services rely on.
    </p>

    <br> </br>

    <p>
        Content-based filtering: 
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">    
        In content-based filtering, each item has a series of tags. For instance, a movie
        might be tagged as "drama", "action", or "more than 90 minutes". Then, when a user interacts with an item,
        they are simply recommended more items that share tags with that item. This style of filtering is usually
        used when there a fairly limited set of items, and it's possible to manually tag each item. When there are 
        more items, designers sometimes ask users to tag items themselves, using hashtags.
        <br> </br>
        In these systems, the designers don't know or remember any information about users or their behavior. These 
        systems are also fairly limited in their actual application, considering most recommendation systems are intended
        to recommend for specific users with specific behavior. You might recognize these systems in services like IKEA, 
        or other shopping websites.
    </p>
    
    <br></br>

    <p>
        Collaborative filtering: 
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 10px">
        In collaborative filtering, items do not have any tags. Instead, the system remembers
        each users' interactions with each item, and then uses those interactions to identify similar users. Once it has
        recognized these similarities, it recommends users' items that other similar users have interacted with. This 
        type of system can be beneficial for designers, because the designers of the system don't need to know any
        information about the items.

        <br> </br>
        I've created a visualization of how this logic operates on a more technical level, which you can see 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MQ1n-UeYwrBW7ot11Jf-7LYqujrdRcRwX6wxCGPQr0k/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>

        <br> </br>
        In naive implementations of these systems, the designers might only remember ratings, but in more advanced versions,
        like the ones used in TikTok, YouTube, and most social medias, they can remember much more information. For instance,
        they might remember view-time, likes, comments, shares to other sites, or other interaction metrics. They might also
        use demographic data that has been provided to them by the user or by third-party information brokers.

        <br> </br>
        One of the consequences of this approach is that the amount of data stored can become unwieldy. For instance, if you
        had 1,000 users and 1,000 items, you would need to remember slots for 1,000,000 interactions. If you had 1,000,000 users
        and 1,000,000 items, you would need to remember 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) interactions. Notably, most of these
        interactions will be empty, because each user will probably not interact with each item.

        <br> </br>
        Designers have many options to solve this problem. Notably, they can use matrix factorization and machine learning. In 
        most complicated systems, developers try to mimick the item-tagging from content-based filtering by using statistical
        models and artificial intelligence to 'guess' some tags associated with items.  One of the consequences of this approach 
        is that the actual meanings of these tags are not visible to the designers. They'll receive a tag that looks like: 
        "latent-factor-1: 0.57628", and have to accept that it contains some level of meaning that enables their system to give 
        more specific recommendations.
    </p>

    <br> </br>
    <br> </br>

    <p>
        If I were to work more on this project, I would implement a basic collaborative filtering algorithm, using a series
        of sample interactions I've already received by surveying some of my classmates. That data can be seen below. If you're
        interested in seeing which images correspond to which numbers, check out the <a href="imageViz.html">image list</a>.
